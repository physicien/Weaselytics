    """
    Log transformation used in the calculation of BEADS frequency cutoff. For
    further information, see [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : array-like
        The data to transform.
    epsilon : float
        An arbitrary positive offset. The larger the offset, the less
        aggressive the pre-treatment. Default is 1. This value is appropriate
        regarding the magnitude of the signals being processed, which reach
        maxima around 500–10,000. Another reason for selecting ``epsilon = 1``
        is because if ``yi = min (y)``, then 
        ``log (yi − min(y) + 1) = log 1 = 0``.

    Returns
    -------
    log_s : numpy.ndarray
        The log transformed data.
